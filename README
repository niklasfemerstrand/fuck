FUCK is an acronym for Fuck Useless Cellphone Keypads and is a project written
to generate alternatives to the ITU-T E.161 keypad. FUCK opens a textfile,
counts the occurance of each character and generates a keypad optimized for the
input text.

Alphabetical keypads, such as the ITU-T E.161 standard keypad, is nowhere
a sufficient way of writing. For more information about the ITU-T E.161
standard, please review the links below:
